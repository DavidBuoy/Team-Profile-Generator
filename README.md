## Description
This is a program that allows you to add employees via the terminal command line once you are done it prints it to an html page. 

* I used Node JS and Javascript and custom classes to make this application work.

## User Story

The user should be able to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info for quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles. Via the command-line an application that accepts user input.
The user is prompted for my team members and their information and HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.

When I click on an email address in the HTML, my default email program opens and populates the field of the email with the address. If I click on the GitHub username, that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.

When I start the application the user is prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number. after the user enters the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number they are presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team. This should be the same for intern and engineer with a couple of different questions then the manager.
